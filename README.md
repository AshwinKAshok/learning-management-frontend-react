# Learning-management-system project - frontend implementation using React

This is the frontend implementation for the project "Learning-management-system". It is implemented 
using React and Redux. It is an attempt to learn React by trying to implementing all
the frontend UI features using React. The same set of features are also implemented using
Angular as an attempt to learn Angular.

The Angular based frontend client of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/AshwinKAshok/learning-management-frontend-angular).

# What it does?

The React client provides the frontend features to:

* Add/remove/update courses
* Add/remove/update Lessons under courses
* Add/remove/update modules under lessons

# Different parts of this project

This project was used as a way to learn different tech stacks. The frontend
and backend of the project has been implemented different using different technologies.
However, due to the consistency of API structure across 2 different
 backend technologies used, any frontend client can be connected to any of the 
 backend application and the web application will still run fine.
